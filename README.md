## Getting Started

1. Clone this through Git or Downoad it as a Zip file.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies to get things going.
3. Run `gulp` to start the project up.
4. Code away!

## How to Work on Code

While you have gulp running in a terminal window, edit any file in the `src` directory. When saved, resulting files will be rendered to the root of the project directory.
